ASOP is a general global optimization algorithm, that was\r\npartially inspired by [ISE][1], [Particle filter][2], [Genetic Algorithms][3]\r\nand other techniques and algorithms.\r\n\r\nThis is a work in progress. Unfortunately, almost no documentation is\r\navailable yet. You are more than welcome to [contact the author][4] for more\r\ndetails, help and help suggestions.\r\n\r\n## Cloning ASOP\r\nThe best way to obtain this library is to go its [Github tags page][5] and\r\nto download the latest tag.\r\n\r\nIf you decided to clone ASOP, bare in mind that ASOP repository contains\r\na submodule ([randomArbitrary][6] -- lirandom number generators for arbitrary\r\ndistributions). Therefore, the proper way of cloning ASOP is\r\n\r\n\tgit clone --recursive <path-to-ASOP>\r\n\r\nIf you forgot to clone recursively, you will see an empty directory\r\nnamed `randomArbitrary`. Don't worry. Just go to the ASOP\r\ndirectory, and run the following command:\r\n\r\n\tgit submodule update --init\r\n\r\n\r\n##Contacting the author\r\nASOP was written by Boris Gorelik.
